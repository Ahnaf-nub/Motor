# MotorDriver Library for Arduino and Micropython
## Overview
The MotorDriver library provides an easy-to-use interface for controlling motors with a motor driver. The library supports both Arduino and MicroPython, allowing you to control motor speed and direction.

## Features
**Control motor and motor speed using PWM.**
**Set motor direction (forward/reverse).**
**Supports both Arduino and MicroPython environments.**
## Installation
**For Arduino**
1. Download the repository as a ZIP file.
1. Extract the contents.
3. Copy the Motor folder to your Arduino libraries directory (<Arduino directory>/libraries/).
4. Restart the Arduino IDE.
**MicroPython**
1. Download the motor.py file from the repository.
2. Upload the file to your MicroPython board using a IDE like Thonny IDE.

## Examples
**Arduino Example**
An example Arduino sketch is available in the `Motor/tree/main/Arduino/Examples` directory.
Example Sketch: `example.ino`
**MicroPython Example**
An example MicroPython script is available in the `Motor/tree/main/Micropython` directory.
Example Script: `example.py`
