## Features
**Control motor and motor speed using PWM.**
**Set motor direction (forward/reverse).**
**Supports both Arduino and MicroPython environments.**
## Installation
**For Arduino**
1. Download the `Motor.zip` file.
3. In Arduino IDE select sketch and then click Include Library and then click Add .Zip Library
   
**For MicroPython**
1. Download the motor.py file from the repository.
2. Upload the file to your MicroPython board using a IDE like Thonny IDE.

## Examples
